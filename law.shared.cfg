[versions]

# default versions of specific tasks to pin
# the key can consist of multple underscore-separated parts, that can each be patterns or regexes
# these parts are used for the lookup from within tasks and can contain (e.g.) the analysis name,
# the config name, the task family, the dataset name, or the shift name
# (see AnalysisTask.get_config_lookup_keys() - and subclasses - for the exact order)
# note:
# this lookup is skipped if the lookup based on the config instance's auxiliary data succeeded
# example:
; c22post__cf.CalibrateEvents__nomin*: prod1

# cf.CalibrateEvents: common2
# hbw_dl__cf.SelectEvents: prod3
# hbw_dl__cf.ReduceEvents: prod3
# hbw_dl__cf.MergeReductionStats: prod3
# hbw_dl__cf.MergeReducedEvents: prod3
# hbw_dl__cf.MergeSelectionStats: prod3
# hbw_dl__cf.MergeSelectionMasks: prod3
# hbw_dl__cf.CreateCutflowHistograms: prod3
